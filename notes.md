\section{Empirical ideas}

\subsection{CPS data}
Using CPS data, see if hours variance has increased and whether it depends on the $w/p$ ratio.
We could restrict attention to retail and service workers. 
The prediction is that with the advent of Kronos scheduling, those with a particularly low $w/p$ ratio were generally over-staffed and so should see an hours reduction compared to other workers.
I know, it's crappy.

I do kind of want to do a project w/ CPS data because I've never used it and I'd like to force myself to become at least familiar with it. 

In terms of potential identification strategies---several states/cities have passed worker scheduling predictability laws, such as VT and SF (e.g., schedules have to be set two weeks in advance).
However, most are quite recent and do not seem particularly strong.
And the SF one appears to have been watered down substantially, probably because the original version was so unworkable.
One thing that employers can do is give a worker a shift with almost no hours, then offer then ``extra'' work later. 

\subsection{Get data from Kronos}
Not likely, but they are based in MA.
Of course, there would be no ``before'' in the data. 

\subsection{Use Upwork/oDesk data}
It would be easy to identify hourly customer service jobs and then see if the firm has to pay a premium if hours have a high variance.
More generally, we could see if there appears to be a volume discount in wages. 
There is the minimum wage experiment which might have exogeneously shifted them to understaff.
Though that's a different question.
I guess the issue w/ the oDesk data is that there is nothing about an increase in precision.
